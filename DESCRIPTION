Description: Easily import multi-frequency acoustic data stored in 'HAC' files (see <doi:10.17895/ices.pub.5482> for more information on the format), and produce echogram visualisations with predefined or customized color palettes. It is also possible to merge consecutive echograms; mask or delete unwanted echogram areas; model and subtract background noise; and more important, develop, test and interpret different combinations of frequencies in order to perform acoustic filtering of the echogram's data.
